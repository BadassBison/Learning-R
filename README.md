# Learning-R
My collection while I learn and master R

I am currently self-teaching myself the language R and Rstudio.
I have some basic web development programming background with html, css, and javascript through school.
I have not worked in a field where I have been able to use these skills and would love to be a programmer someday
Right now this is a hobby, but have quickly learned that coding is a passion.
I still get very confused at times with terminology but hope to understand this vast area more thoroughly soon
